Hey Me in the Future 

This is a tough time for you but cheer up :D keep eating healthy and doing what you're doing, get involved and go outside more you doof. Better late than never, should have done this in 2013. Go back to Flash and do what you did before, it was more of what you wanted to do but didnt realize it until now. Even though you think there are ppl that can do the things you do better than you dont let that stop you. Take your own advice man.
